# MusicPlayerApp
I’ve been working on creating a music player application using MongoDB, React.js, Express, Tailwind CSS, and Multer. The goal of this project was to understand the concepts like Context API for state management, routing for navigation, and backend logic through controllers and middlewares. Additionally, handling file uploads to cloud storage using Multer.

This isn’t a full-fledged application but rather a hands-on approach to learning these technologies in a practical and meaningful way. It’s been a great opportunity to connect the dots between different parts of the stack and see how they work together.
Also run backend server simultaneously to load the frontend.
